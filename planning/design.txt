Mole Design - Mole Buster

Overview:
- Moles appear from holes in the grassy field at random positions and random intervals.
- Players do not jump; they move over or near holes and perform a hit action to score.

Spawn Behavior:
- Moles pop up out of random holes.
- Each mole remains visible for a random duration between 3 and 15 seconds.
- While visible, a mole can be hit exactly once for its full point value.
- After being hit or timing out, the mole retreats and the hole becomes eligible for another spawn.

Mole Types and Scoring:
- Standard Mole: worth +5 points.
- Deluxe Mole: worth +15 points (rarer spawn, visually distinct).
- Penalty Mole: worth -10 points (discourages random spamming).

Notes:
- Exact spawn rates and type probabilities are controlled via game balance config (per game mode).
- Versus mode will extend these rules with player-colored moles (matching color = positive, others = negative).
